# metaheuristics
Class project

To execute the code, you need to run the compiled `coloration.c` file and specify the input graph file like `color/dsjc125.1.col` 
For example your command could look like `C:\Whateverisyourpath\metaheuristics>colorations color/dsjc125.1.col`

The solution will be written in the `solutions` folder and will have the same name as the input file but with `.sol`
