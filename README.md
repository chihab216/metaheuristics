# metaheuristics
Class project

To execute the code, you need to run the compiled `coloration.c` file and specify the input graph file like `color/dsjc125.1.col`

For example your command could look like `C:\Whateverisyourpath\metaheuristics>colorations color/dsjc125.1.col`


The solution will be written in the `solutions` folder and will have the same name as the input file but with `.sol`

Our approach uses the [Brelaz (Dsatur)](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSATUR) to find an initial solution and then applies [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) to optimize the solution.

The runnig time of the program is limited to 60 seconds so that it respect the rules of the assignment.
